# PROG1700-quiz-creation
Quiz.py is my final project from my PROG1700 course.
This program is written in python, and prompts the user to answer submit and series of questions and their answers, which are then saved as a file.
This file can then be used as a quiz which will prompt users with questions, record their answers, and display their marking.
